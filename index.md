# Welcome to my Page!

I'm glad you are here. I'll be selling my company in the near future and have always had an interest in coding. I have some basic skills, I started with a Commodore 64 in the '80s, took a few computer science classes in the 90s, a C++ class or two in college. I've mainly used HTML at work, formatting parts of our webpages and emails.

I'm starting over with the basics, HTML and CSS were recommended by a few articles as good starting points. I'm excited to get started on a new, hopefully more fulfilling part of my life where I can help others (and make a living wage while I'm at it).
